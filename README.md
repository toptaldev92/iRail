This is the iRail Git repo.

iRail is an attempt to make transportation time schedules easily available for anyone. 

We are doing this by creating an Application Programming Interface. This interface is implemented in PHP and can be reused by various of other projects.

Our main site consists of a very easy mobile website to look up time schedules using our own API.

Native applications using the iRail API and created or supported by the iRail team are named BeTrains.

All information can be found on [Project iRail](http://project.irail.be/).
